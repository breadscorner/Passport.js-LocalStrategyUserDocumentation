# Glossary  

## Important Terms

### Array

A data structure in programming used to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable

### Authentication

The process of verifying the identity of a user or system entity attempting to access a resource or service

### Database

A structured collection of data that is stored and organized in a way that enables efficient retrieval and management of the data

### Edge Cases

An edge case is an uncommon or unexpected scenario that can cause errors or failures in a program. It can reveal vulnerabilities in a system or application and is important to consider during development and testing.

### Endpoint

An endpoint is a web address that a client (like a browser or mobile app) can use to access a specific function or data provided by a web application. Each endpoint is associated with a specific way of asking for or providing data, such as sending or retrieving information, updating, or deleting.

### Initialize

The process of setting up and preparing a system, application, or module for use by configuring its initial state and variables

### Library

A collection of pre-written code that can be reused by other software programs to perform common functions

### Localhost

A term used to refer to the local computer that a developer is working on, which is typically identified by the IP address 127.0.0.1

### Middleware

Middleware is software that connects different applications or systems and facilitates communication and data exchange between them. Middleware allows the user to use functions throughout the application development not just in one file.

### Module

A self-contained block of code that performs a specific function and can be imported or exported to be used in other programs

### Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable network applications.

### Nodemon

A tool that automatically restarts a Node.js application whenever changes are made to the code, making the development process faster and more efficient

### NPM (Node Package Manager)

A package manager for the JavaScript programming language that allows developers to easily download, install, and manage third-party libraries and tools

### Object

A data structure in programming used to store multiple values of different data types in a single variable, organized as key-value pairs

### Open-source

A term used to describe software that is developed and made available to the public under an open-source license, which allows anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute the software's source code

### Passport.js

A popular authentication library for Node.js that provides a set of customizable authentication strategies, such as local, OAuth, and OpenID

### Query

A request for information or data from a database or other data source, typically written in a programming language such as SQL

### Routes

In web development, routes define the paths or URLs that a user can access on a website or web application, and the functions or actions that should be executed when the user accesses those paths

## Serialize and deserialize

The process of converting data from one format to another for storage, transmission, or processing. Serialization involves converting an object or data structure to a string or binary format, while deserialization involves converting the serialized data back into an object or data structure

### Sessions

A way to persist data across multiple requests in a web application. A session is created when a user logs in or visits a website, and can store user-specific data such as login credentials, shopping cart items, or user preferences

### Software registry

A centralized database that stores information about software packages, such as their name, version, dependencies, and license. Users can search and download software packages from the registry, and developers can publish and manage their packages

### Strategies

Strategies are ways to check if a request is real or not. They do this by using something called an authentication mechanism, which is like a secret code that proves you are who you say you are. For example, this code could be a password or a special message from a trusted source.

### Undefined

A value in programming that indicates the absence of a defined value or variable. It is often used to represent an error or uninitialized variable
