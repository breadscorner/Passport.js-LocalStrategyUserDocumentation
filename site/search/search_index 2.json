We use a function(name of function) from our fake-db.js to query for the user based off of their username. The returned value from that function is stored inside a variable.</p> <p>Example: </p> <p><code>code example deserializeUser</code></p> <p>If the variable contains an object(username, password), we run done(null, user). This done function puts the user object inside req.user, which can be accessed for a future usage.</p> <p>If the variable contains undefined, we run done({message: \"\"}, null), where the message is sent to the servers console(VSCode console) to tell the user that the function failed to retrieve a matching user with the requested username.</p> <p>Example</p>"},{"location":"strategies/#export-local-login","title":"Export Local Login","text":"<p>You need to tell passport that you want to use local strategy and that you want to export passport so that it can be used in app.js.</p>"},{"location":"strategies/#1add-code-to-export-module","title":"1.Add Code To Export Module","text":"<p>Add a line of code to the bottom of passport.js.</p> <p>Example: </p> <p><code>code example</code></p> <p>By running this you modify passport to use your local login strategy.
