# Choosing Passport.js

We learned passport.js in term two of our Full Stack Web Development Diploma but found it difficult because there is so little information on how to implement it into an express program.

Due to the limited user documentation on passport.js we decided it was important to create a beginner friendly version.

Due to the vast amount of strategies, such as login with Google, FB, etc. we decided to start with a local strategy, meaning simply logging in with a username and password.

## Overview of Passport.js User Documentation

Welcome! We have created documentation to guide you through setting up a local strategy for passport.js authentication.

The goal of this documentation is to provide you with enough information to build your first Express application using passport.js for login authentication. Our focus is to get your application up and running with authentication. However, we do provide several links to brush up on some relevant topics. We have also included several areas for advanced users to add features to their application.

Topics that will be covered include:

- Introduction to Passport.js
- Preliminary Setup & Installation
- Strategies & Implementing A Database
- Route Handling & Passport.js Implementation
- Troubleshooting
- Important Terminology

## How We Collaborated Together

This user guide assignment occurred while our classes were completely held online. Our main form of communication was over Discord instant messaging after we brainstormed our guide idea and instruction outline over Zoom.

To complete this documentation we worked diligently in the class time we were provided.

We used GitHub to collaborate when we were not in class. Brett operated on the master branch whilst Gary used a separate branch Once we communicated with each other we would merge Gary to the master branch. Additionally, we met up at campus to work more on this project together.

## How We Created Our Guide

We structured our documentation first and then did our research on the topic of passport.js. We took notes from the limited documentation and our class videos to create our own version of a passport local strategy and then transformed it into this documentation.

Once we had added all the information into the document we did a read through for two reasons.

1.To find words we believed to be important and add them to the glossary.

2.To run through the steps and make sure we did not miss any. This lead us to realize we need to really structure our time.

As we added instructions, our glossary grew. We linked these terms throughout our document to the terms in the glossary.

We proceeded to start styling our user documentation and added admonitions to organize separate topics like what an advanced user may do, or what the completed code should look like.

One important step in our editing portion of creating this documentation was peer reviewing, or user testing. We had our user documentation tested by several classmates at different junctions in the creation. This allowed us to gain an outside perspective as to what users needed to succeed.

## Choosing MkDocs

We used the mkdocs material theme because we liked the look. [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme provided us a good foundation for our user documentation but we did make several changes to help with contrast and overall design. We used several plugins for admonitions, block quotes, and a customized logo.
